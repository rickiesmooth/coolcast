# Welcome to Graphcool!
#
# This file is the main config file for your Graphcool Service.
# It's very minimal at this point and uses default values.
# We've included a hello world function here.
# Just run `graphcool deploy` to have the first running Graphcool Service.
#
# Check out some examples:
#    https://github.com/graphcool/graphcool/tree/master/examples
#
# Here are the reference docs of this definition format:

# Happy Coding!
